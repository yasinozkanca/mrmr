mrmrTest is the main you will run. Just load the features and labels in whatever way you like as a matrix then start it. If you havent done any normalization on data there is already one built-in you can use it otherwise just comment it out. When the program is done running the featFCD array is the array that sorts the feature index from most important to redundant. Just use it as an index to an array.
